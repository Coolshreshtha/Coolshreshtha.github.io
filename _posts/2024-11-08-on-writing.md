title: Writing - Why and How for Me
---
"So before you can build a better writing habit, you need to ask yourself how you want writing to contribute to your life." [^1]

For me, I'm hoping to write to build consistency and expertise in an area I already consider one of my strengths. But, in addition, I also want my writing to be a demonstrable product of my thinking and learning work, a way to make tangible the seemingly intangible and oft-considered "useless" work.  I want it to be a space for deep dives into stuff I really enjoy and in that way attract things and people that are aligned with them.  Plus, It's good to have a project that's always novel and always fun and one I would be happy to spend time on.

I associate good writing with good thinking and good thinking with smart people so I would hope to work up to that level.

Lately, I notice that alignment begets alignment, and doing what you like brings me closer to other stuff I also like. Maybe writing will be the nudge to many more fulfilling things <3.

As I was reading up for this, I kept going into webs of linked articles (I'll link the relevant ones), so maybe this is just an elaborate excuse to go down interesting rabbit holes :)
